Ignore the Makefile

To test your test function, open the folder of your program in the terminal. Either navigate in the terminal,
or right-click on the folder, and select "Open in Integrated Terminal"
If you've run your program, an executable of your code is automatically created with the same name as your .cpp
file, with a .exe extention.

Type the command "./<program_name> test"

Ex: ./main.exe test

If your test assert statements work, the final cout in the test function will print, otherwise the program will stop with
an assertion error.

Take screenshots of your program execution and test
